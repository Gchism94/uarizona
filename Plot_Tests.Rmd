```{r iris}
summary(iris)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot <- ggplot2::ggplot(iris, ggplot2::aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)) +
  ggplot2::geom_point(ggplot2::aes(colour = Species)) +
  ggplot2::labs(title = "This Title is in Duke Royal Blue!", caption = "This caption is in Duke Navy Blue!", x = "This is copper!", y = "This is Persimmon!")

plot + theme_duke()
```

```{r}
plot2 <- ggplot(iris, aes(x=Petal.Length)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(title = "Royal Blue", caption = "Navy Blue")

plot2 + theme_duke()
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
